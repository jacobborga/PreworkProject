			<p>Welcome to my personal site where I will demonstrate what I learned through the Flatiron pre-course work
				including HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
			<p>For the past few years I have been attempting to learn the aspects of programming and CS as well as how
				programming works in the real world. Hopefully on this journey I will meet a lot of new people, learn a
				lot
				of new and exciting things, and explore new ideas through Flatiron. This website not only contains
				information about me, but it also includes my favorite waterski designs in gallery format. Click the
				waterski button below to see the gallery, or explore around a little more if you want!</p>

			<h2 id="aboutMeHeader">About Me</h2>
			<p>From a young age I have been interested in computers. From modifying online games like Minecraft, to
				building static websites experimenting with code. Over that duration I wasn't as serious as I am now
				about pursuing a career out of code, but with the demand of developers being this high it isn't an
				opportunity I can miss. I also have a few other non-code-related interests such as hiking through the
				amazing Colorado Rockies, and waterskiing on many of the beautiful lakes here.</p>

		<div class="experiment-container">
			<h2 id="experimentHeader">What have I experimented with?</h2>
			<p>I have experimented with different concepts outside of this pre-work such as <b><a
						href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="">React.Js</a></b>,
				<b><a href="https://jquery.com" target="_blank" rel="">jQuery</a></b> and even backend frameworks like
				<b><a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="">Node.Js</a></b> with <b><a href=""
						target="_blank" rel="">Express.Js</a></b>.</p>
			<p>Like a lot of developers out there, I fell in love with working in React. From having abstract components
				that can be used anywhere in your project, to a wide range of libraries that give you the tools to
				succeed.</p>
			<p>I also know Typescript and how to use it to create a more efficient workflow along with a better
				visualization of your data.</p>
