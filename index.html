		<p>Welcome to my personal site where I will demonstrate what I learned through the Flatiron pre-course work
			including HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
		<p>For the past few years I have been attempting to learn the aspects of programming and CS as well as how
			programming works in the real world. Hopefully on this journey I will meet a lot of new people, learn a lot
			of new and exciting things, and explore new ideas through Flatiron. This website not only contains
			information about me, but it also includes my favorite waterski designs in gallery format. Click the
			waterski button below to see the gallery, or explore around a little more if you want!</p>
